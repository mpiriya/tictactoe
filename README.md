# TicTacToe
A JavaScript TicTacToe Website

## Usage
- Open the [link](https://mpiriya.github.io/tictactoe/) to the website
- Enter Player 1 and Player 2 names and whether you would like them to be computers or not
  - You can make both computers, but it will tie and end in the same game state every time
- Play!
- You can open settings to edit the names and/or whether each player is a CPU
  - All 4 permutations of humans and computers work, so feel free to try them all :)
- Press restart to, well, restart the game

## What I learned
- How to use Factories and Modules to my advantage
- The minimax algorithm which finds the best move given a tic-tac-toe game state

## What I can still add
- Clean up on the CSS by using classes and attributes more efficiently/consistently
- Work on the JavaScript and make it less spaghetti-like. Already did a good amount on that, though
